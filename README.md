I always try to solve a problem qualitatively and without shirking. But before this I like decompose the system, make schemes, tables, flow charts. In one word, carry out a System Analysis of the Domain knowledge. I have some experience work in a team, and I want to work with a team of professionals and develop useful and quality IT products. Also, I like step by step self-learning new technologies and apply them in practice, but don't forget about fundamental things (like OSI, TCP/IP or Relational model). I want to achieve new heights, improve my professional and personal soft and hard skills, meet new peoples and get a new experience. |
